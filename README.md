# DSA Learning Journal

This repository serves as a personal journal for studying Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It organizes learning resources, theory, and practical exercises across various DSA topics.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- **Background Theory** (`background_theory`): Contains foundational concepts and theory needed to understand each data structure and algorithm. Review this section for core DSA topics and their explanations.

- **Detailed Implementation Practice** (`data_structure_implement`): Provides in-depth implementations of data structures to reinforce the theoretical concepts found in `background_theory`. This section allows for more extensive exploration and experimentation with the code when deeper practice is needed.

- **Practice Problems** (`problem`): Contains exercises and coding challenges for hands-on practice with different DSA concepts. Organized by difficulty level, this section is designed to help solidify understanding through real-world applications.

## Additional Files

In the root directory, youâ€™ll also find several auxiliary files:

- **`tool.sh`**: A script designed to streamline the process of adding new problems or theory topics to the repository. This script automates routine additions, so feel free to ignore it unless contributing to repository maintenance.

- **`automation_completion.sh`**: Support autocomplete for automation.sh command, still ignore it unless contributing to repository maintenance. (Add **source /path/to/automation_completion.sh** to the end of **~/.bashrc** and run **source ~/.bashrc** to apply)

- **`methods.txt`**: A list of algorithms included in the `background_theory` section, providing an easy reference to the covered methods.

- **`problems.txt`**: A list of all practice problems available in the repository, with references to specific exercises for convenient tracking and review.

- **`structures.txt`**: A catalog of data structures discussed in the `background_theory` section, serving as a quick reference to theoretical concepts.

## Usage

1. **Study Theory**: Begin by reviewing concepts in `background_theory`.
2. **Implement and Deepen Understanding**: For further practice on key topics, work through the examples in `data_structure_implement`.
3. **Apply and Practice**: Reinforce learning by tackling problems in the `problem` directory.

Happy learning, and keep track of your progress as you delve into each area of DSA!
